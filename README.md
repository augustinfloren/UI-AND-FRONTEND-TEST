# Loud Tracker

A minimalist, interactive volume meter app in the style of a plugin with a radial histogram and time-based scaling features. 

## Features
- **Radial Histogram**: Real-time audio volume visualization using a radial histogram.
- **Time Scale Adjustment**: Switch between different time scales for more detailed or broader analysis.
- **Reset**: Reset the visualization to restart the measurementd.
- **Elapsed Time Display**: Track the time passed since the measurement began.

## Intent

The goal of this plugin was to align with the brandâ€™s minimalist design guidelines, although I ran out of time to fully complete the vision. The core idea was to create a sleek and functional tool with a clean aesthetic. You can find the mockup in the repository to get a better understanding of the direction I had in mind for this project.
